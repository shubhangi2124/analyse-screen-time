Analyzing User Screen Time Patterns and Notification Influence on App Engagement

Project Overview

This project explores user screen time data to identify engagement patterns and assess the impact of notifications on app usage. The primary goal is to analyze how notifications trigger app openings and contribute to overall screen time, providing insights that can help users manage their digital interactions more effectively.

Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises key metrics from widely used apps such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Netflix, LinkedIn, and X (formerly Twitter), alongside lesser-used apps like 8 Ball Pool and Safari. The main variables include:

Date: The recorded date of app usage.

App: The specific app being analyzed (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp).

Usage (minutes): Total daily screen time per app.

Notifications: Number of notifications received daily per app.

Times Opened: Frequency of app openings per day.

Key Insights

Our analysis reveals notable daily screen time trends, with peak usage observed on Mondays and Wednesdays and lower engagement towards the end of the week. Instagram exhibits consistently high screen time and frequent notifications, whereas Netflix users tend to have prolonged but fewer sessions, indicative of binge-watching behavior.

One striking finding is that the probability of opening an app upon receiving a notification is consistently 1.0 across all apps. This suggests that notifications play a crucial role in driving app engagement, making them a significant factor in digital habits.

Conclusion

This study underscores the role of notifications as a key driver of screen time across multiple apps. Users looking to reduce their app usage may benefit from disabling notifications as an initial step. By providing a clear view of engagement patterns and notification-driven behaviors, this project offers valuable insights into fostering healthier digital habits and effective screen time management.
